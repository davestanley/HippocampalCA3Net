This is the main Genesis code. There are two ways to run this code

1) Simple GENESIS mode. For this mode, simply run main_default.g

main_default.g - Runs a single full network simulation with default parameters.


2) Circadian mode with parameter sweeps. For this mode, you need to run ssh_script.sh and supply an integer as an argument (0 - 5). This controls which simulation is run for producing the figures in the paper.

ssh_script.sh - Batch system for creating all the simulations used in the paper. For a test run, type “./ssh_script.sh 0”. See comments in file for details.

sag_params*.g - Genesis scripts generated by ssh_script.sh. These define the parameters that are swept over in parallel simulations.

main_script.g - Genesis script called by sag_params*.g (indirectly called by ssh_script.sh) Runs the actual Genesis simulation and saves the output data.
