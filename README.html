<b>Overview:</b>This model produces the hippocampal CA3 neural network model used 
in the paper below. It has two modes of operation, a default mode and
a circadian mode. In the circadian mode, parameters are swept through a
range of values. 

This model can be quite easily adapted to produce theta and gamma oscillations,
as certain parameter sweeps will reveal (see Figures). BASH scripts interact
with GENESIS 2.3 to implement parameter sweeps.

The model contains four cell types derived from prior papers. CA3 pyramidal
are derived from Traub et al (1991); Basket,  stratum oriens (O-LM), and
Medial Septal GABAergic (MSG) interneurons are taken from Hajos et al (2004).

<b>Running the default model:</b>
1) Unzip downloaded file (if necessary)
2) Make sure that the genesis binary is in your current path
3) Change directory into simfiles and type genesis main_default.g
4) Data analysis scripts are located in matlab_plotting/extract_data.
The file analyse_script.m will automatically load and plot simulation
data in Matlab.

<b>Running the circadian model:</b>
The simfiles folder also contains a script called ssh_script.sh. This
is used for setting up batch simulations to conduct parameter sweeps.
Some parameters in the model depend on time (see Methods, Stanley 2013)
this script enables one to sweep through different times of day.

For additional help customizing the model and automatic processing of
batch simulations, please contact the authors.
