This model produces the hippocampal CA3 neural network model used 
in the paper below. In addition to generating the standard network,
(shown below) it can also generate a network with varying degrees
of GABAergic septal denervation. BASH scripts interact with GENESIS
2.3 to conduct a large range of parameter sweeps.

The model contains four cell types derived from prior papers.
CA3 pyramidal are derived from Traub et al 1991; basket, 
stratum oriens (O-LM), and medial Septal GABAergic
(MSG) interneurons are taken from Hajos et al (2004).

<b>Running the default model:</b>
1) Unzip file
2) Change directory into simfiles and type genesis main_default.g
3) Data analysis scripts are located in matlab_plotting/extract_data.
The file analyse_script.m will automatically load and plot simulation
data in Matlab.

<b>Running the circadian model:</b>
The simfiles folder also contains a script called ssh_script.sh. This
is used for setting up batch simulations to conduct parameter sweeps.
Some parameters in the model depend on time (see Methods, Stanley 2013)
this script enables one to sweep through different times of day.

For additional help customizing the model and automatic processing of
batch simulations, please contact the authors.
